# Groovy Null and Empty String Handling

This example demonstrates a common issue in Groovy related to handling null and empty strings. The `myMethod` function checks for null or empty input, but the behavior may not be intuitive to developers coming from other languages.

The `bug.groovy` file shows the flawed logic, while `bugSolution.groovy` provides a more robust approach.  The core issue is how Groovy handles comparisons involving null values. This improved version leverages Groovy's more flexible comparison operators to address the subtlety.
